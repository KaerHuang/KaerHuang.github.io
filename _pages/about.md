I am a senior researcher at Lenovo Research. My research interest is computer vision, including detection, segmentation, tracking algorithms (MOT/MOTS/VIS/VOS/VOT/3D Tracking), visual foundation models, and deep generative models(Diffusion models and their application).

🎉I have several openings for self-motivated research interns on these topics, please feel free to drop me an e-mail( huangke1@lenovo.com)🎉.
